# Sushi Store üç£

Welcome to the repository for my fictional sushi store, a modern web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and TypeScript. This project showcases a strongly typed implementation that leverages the powerful (and beautiful) UI components from shadcn-ui and uses Zustand for efficient state management.

## Features

- **Strong Typing**: Developed with TypeScript to ensure reliability and enhance developer productivity through static typing.
- **UI Components**: Utilizes [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for sleek and responsive UI components.
- **State Management**: State management is handled by [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/), providing a simple and scalable solution for managing global state.
